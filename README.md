One of the, if not the first, projects I made. 
It keeps track of your wins, losses, ties, and streaks, and even has a local leaderboard to see your top scores.
You can toggle between light and dark mode, reset your score, and watch confetti when you win.
This was one of my first projects, built to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while making a fun interactive game.
